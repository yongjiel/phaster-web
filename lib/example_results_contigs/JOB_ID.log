tRNAscan-SE v.1.23 (April 2002) - scan sequences for transfer RNAs

  Please cite:

	improved detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence"
	Nucl. Acids Res. 25: 955-964.

  This program uses a modified, optimized version of tRNAscan v1.3
  (Fichant & Burks, J. Mol. Biol. 1991, 220: 659-671),
  a new implementation of a multistep weight matrix algorithm
  for identification of eukaryotic tRNA promoter regions
  (Pavesi et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 1994, 22: 1247-1256),
  as well as the RNA covariance analysis package Cove v.2.4.2
  (Eddy & Durbin, Nucl. Acids Res. 1994, 22: 2079-2088).
